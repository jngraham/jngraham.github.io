      <p>The Radcliffe Camera is one of the iconic libraries of the University of Oxford with a beautiful interior to match the exterior. The building looms large over Radcliffe Square and Brasenose and All Souls colleges, matched only by the grandeur of the University Church of Saint Mary. This was a tricky build, geometrically speaking, but it was assisted by some of the new bar/stud pieces recently released by The Lego Group. Unfortunately, some of the pieces included aren't available in the necessary tan colour (such as the cheese-grater slopes) so to realise this design I'd have to resort to paint or dye.</p>

      <p>The rendering of this piece is more sophisticated than that of my previous models, because I took the effort finally to learn in a rudimentary way to use Blender. As wonderful as the results are, it's always a bit stressful asking my wheezing, ageing laptop to crunch heavy numbers like that, so Blender is definitly reserved for special occasions, such as presenting this wonderful piece of architecture.</p>
