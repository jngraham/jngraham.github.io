      <p>Have degrees; will travel. Find my CV <a href="jngraham_cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Hello, dear reader, and welcome to my site! I am a Washington DC-based graduate of <a href="http://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">theoretical physics</a> and <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/applied-math/" target="_blank">applied mathematics</a>. Solving difficult problems in mathematics and physics, theoretical and applied alike, gives me purpose. I am seeking this purpose in a quantitative and/or software-related role.</p>

      <p>I have varied interests, and I lay them out in these pages for your perusal. To see some things I have worked on, head on over to <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>. On the other hand, if you're interested in pictures I have taken that I'm proud of, go to <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>. If, for some reason, you want to know what goes on inside my head, by all means check out <a href="reading-list.html">Reading List</a>.</p>

      <p>A few interesting tidbits about me:</p>
      <ul style="list-style: disc">
        <li>I have a pet olive tree and I love it very much;</li>
        <li>I ride a rickety bicycle that is older than I am;</li>
        <li>David Macaulay's <i>The New Way Things Work</i> and Ian Stewart's <i>What Shape is a Snowflake?</i> are the most important books I read as a child and helped me become who I am today;</li>
        <li>A photoshoot I did with my boss in 2014 has left me the poster boy for <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/applied-math/undergraduate/combined-bs-ms-program.html" target="_blank">Northwestern's BS/MS in Applied Mathematics</a>;</li>
        <li>I built this site from scratch, with help from <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, for a fun learning experience.</li>
      </ul>
