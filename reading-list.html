      <h1>Reading List</h1>
        <p>One of the things I spend my time doing is reading. Sometimes I read dreadful thrillers with poor character development and many plot holes but, rather enjoyably, play like movies in my head. At other times I prefer 'highbrow' literature, and at other times I go for nonfiction.</p>

        <p>Here I present a list of books I have read according to the year I read them, with and without comment. This list is not guaranteed to be complete, but I attempt to hide nothing about what I read:</p>

              </div>

                  <p>I found understanding some of the later chapters easier when I had a better grasp of general relativity and quantum field theory, but knowledge is by no means a prerequisite to reading this book. Rovelli takes the reader on a journey through the "big picture" of physics from Ancient Greece to the present day. I thought it was an excellent complement to my studies, but the book is primarily written for the general public and succeeds in its accessibility.</p>

                  <p>This ticked a number of boxes for me. I have a soft spot for the history of science, and I have another soft spot for anything Humboldt because of my brief summer at Humbold-Universit&auml;t. Wolf's chapter about the Humboldt brothers, Schiller and Goethe was particularly engaging for me because I am fond of Weimar, but the entire book is a masterwork. The author writes an excellent biography of Alexander von Humboldt but also ties his story into what should be more familiar lives, such as those of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin and John Muir. It was remarkable learning just how much Humboldt's influence spread, and just how concepts that are familiar today were so revolutionary in the past.</p>

                  <p>I do like the theme of people staying in the place where they grew up and not really doing very much, holding on to old times because that's all they really have. That theme crops up in between chapters in which Baldacci lays out a murder mystery that becomes plain as day when an FBI agent relates his knowledge about a suspected serial killer, last active "four years ago". The human moments in this book are to an extent touching but done much better by Steinbeck (surprise, surprise) in Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-8">
                  <p>In the foreword, Bell informs us that this book is the result of a year's study at the Department of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Cambridge, and a concurrent writer-in-residence position at Sidney Sussex College. With this in mind, I was expecting a nuanced, well-researched swashbuckling adventure of the sort Michael Crichton wrote. Instead, like the rest of Bell's oeuvre, this book is as subtle as a punch to the face. The extent of his research seems to be "China is building islands in the South China Sea" and "North Korea has prison camps", things you can learn by reading the news rather than by sequestering yourself in a library for a year.</p>

                  <p>To be sure, I read his novels for the action rather than the realism. As ususal, Bell's teaboo tendencies make him fawn over his protagonist, a forever-young, former-SAS, current-MI6 aristocrat who drives a Bentley named (as the author reminds us almost every other chapter) "the Locomotive". When I read Bell's novels, I just have to roll with the fantasy, but parts of this book beggar belief. An evil Chinese general with two daughters named Jet and Li, and a third daughter (a professor at Cambridge) called Chyna? Sunset in Cornwall at the start of June is around 17:30? A character who on one page is nursing a pipe, then on the next is relighting his cigar? Really?</p>

                  <p>If you want to slog through 500+ pages of drivel for a very weak payout, by all means read this book.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Neil Gaiman, American Gods</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-8">
                  <p>What <i>is</i> American Gods about? It's a weird book, and Gaiman's accompanying writings make clear that it isn't really meant to sit inside one genre. It's a story about stories, about a murder a mystery, about a con artist at work. It's a book about America, a book about how people hold on to certain things and let other things go. It's about a road trip and about Americana. While I was reading it, I thought to myself "this is America." At some points, even, it's about gods.</p>

                  <p>Gaiman writes a pantheon of old and new gods. Halfway through, I was concerned that some of the characters he had introduced to us were written for the sake of it, but pretty much everything in the book has a purpose. Hundreds of pages later, you find out it was worth it. You don't have to be familiar with mythology to read the book, because it's not really about mythology, but a little background knowledge goes a long way in figuring things out faster than Shadow, the protagonist, does.</p>

                  <p>At times I wonder how much of himself Gaiman writes into his characters. For instance, when Wednesday talks about myths and stories, I think he is speaking Gamian's words. The postscript, in which Shadow goes travelling, is written in a markedly different style than the rest of the book, and that tipped me off that it is an autobiographical chapter. What else is there that I haven't noticed?</p>

                  <p>A weird read, certainly, but an adventure.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Daniel Golden, The Price of Admission</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-8">
                  <p>Interesting and thought-provoking reading, particularly about how colleges such as Caltech eschew legacy, development and sports admission preferences. Golden clearly grinds his axe on some examples more than others. What surpised me most was not that there are some egregious cases of parents (or others) squeezing their wholly inadequate children into top universities, but that in so many cases, being a member of a preferred class of applicants (alumni children, donor children, etc.) makes an admission officer more likely to decide to take a chance on a student. It seems that students don't get so many breaks when they don't have these additional factors on their applications.</p>

                  <p>This book made me think a bit about some of the privileges I've enjoyed during my education, and how admissions processes I've experienced have been different. The first one is definitely that I've only had to focus on my education; this is something that Golden only really mentions in the context of the University of California (and other schools) taking into account "life experiences" during admissions, but it's a big one. I haven't had to work, haven't had to support my family. I have had a couple of odd jobs during term, but I took those on out of choice, not necessity.</p>

                  <p>I grew up in a very high-quality school district and attended one of the best high schools in the United States. It's a magnet school I had to apply to to attend, and I insisted on doing my application entirely by myself. I didn't get my way, since my parents decided if I was going to apply, I was going to have to attend a prep class for the admission exam. My first plan was to attend a free class held at my middle school but somehow or another that fell through and I found myself on Saturday mornings practising maths problems and writing short essays with twenty or so other hopefuls. As Golden so frequently points out in his book, a refrain of privileged students is "I'd like to think I got here on my own, but I can't be sure" &mdash; the same definitely holds true for me, here. I can't know how much my prep class helped me, but I know hours of practising exam problems certainly helped. The second round of the admissions process, though, consisted of take-home essays about my interests, and I made sure I completed that entirely on my own; I didn't even let my parents or teachers read my writing. Although the school's policy was that there should be no help in this portion, in practise this was not the case and they've since had to revamp this part of the admissions procedure.</p>

                  <p>When I applied to Oxford I wrote my personal statement myself but had a watchful eye critique what I had written and suggest ways of better conveying what I wanted to say. Famous authors do not simply write everything alone and publish what's left at the end; I feel like I'd have been a fool not to get input into my writing. And of course the three letters of recommendation I needed helped, but the key here was that the professors reading my application only cared about my ability and passion for physics; they didn't care if I was a well-rounded person the way that undergraduate institutions in America do. My undergraduate applications worked very differently from this, and even my high school's, admissions process.</p>

                  <p>When I was applying to university, I insisted on doing things on my own. Like my application to high school, I didn't entirely get my way: my first SAT score was not what I had hoped for, so I wanted to take it again. My mother insisted that I attend a prep class before I took the SAT a second time, but we made a compromise: a student from my school (who got 2400 the first and only time he took the test) had written an SAT guide, so I read that and did problems on my own instead.</p>

                  <p>Coming from my school, I was at a slight disadvantage here because so many of my classmates were more qualified than I was, but I was at a huge advantage compared to students in my county overall. Overwhelming numbers of students to to UVA and William & Mary, Virginia's flagship universities, each year. Many students go to elite colleges; in my year alone, six went to Caltech. My high school is well known to admissions officers and the name confers a heavy weight, and this weighs on me a little bit.</p>

                  <p>I went to Northwestern, not because I particularly wanted to but because I felt I had to. Northwestern was my sister's dream university and, in fact, it only appeared on my radar because she attended a summer school there and fell in love with both the school and Evanston, the city it's in. My sister had amazing high school qualifications: great grades, section leader in marching band, captain of her high school softball team, top performer on another softball team, awesome relationships with her teachers, who no doubt were consequently able to write glittering letters of recommendation for her. But she went to the local high school rather than my famous one, and Northwestern put her on the waiting list. She was ultimately rejected and went to UVA, which she duly fell in love with. But I got into her dream university and she didn't, and how much of that is because of my high school's name?</p>

                  <p>Over the Christmas break in 2015, I was wondering what I wanted to do with myself after my bachelor's degree, and I discovered that Oxford had an MSc in physics. I had fallen out with physics in around 2012 I had come around to the subject again after a detour through computational neuroscience, and I was ready to learn more. Also, I wanted to get out into a new environment. I very quickly put together an application for the late-Januray deadline, in which I sincerely likened physics to magic. I didn't tell my parents I had applied in case things went south.</p>

                  <p>In the middle of March, the winter quarter at Northwestern ended and I had finished my degree. I packed my things and my dad came out to Chicago to help me drive home to Virginia. On the first day I got home, I received an email saying that the folks at Oxford actually wanted me. I quickly switched gears from my job hunt to getting ready to study physics seriously: I had to learn classical mechanics and drill quantum mechanics into my head, which I achieved by doing all the problems in two textbooks I had.</p>

                  <p>For my birthday, my mother got me this book by John Betjeman, a 1970 facsimile of the 1938 original publication. I have no idea quite how she got it, but it used to belong to the Beverley Public Library in Yorkshire. Fear not&mdash;the title page is adorned with a "WITHDRAWN FROM STOCK" stamp. It is a charming little book; an entertaining review of the interwar Oxford life, both in the city and in the university. It has a fabulous appendix describing the architecture of the city: buildings, architects, people associated with them, and other interesting tidbits. And, much to my delight, I discovered the photographs in the book were taken by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, of Bauhaus fame. It's a marvelous book and I learned rather a lot about the city by reading it.</p>

                  <p>One afternoon while I was in Berlin I went to Prenzlauer Berg to get my hair cut. As I walked from the tram stop along Prenzlauer Allee, I passed a comic book store and had a look in since I had some time to kill.</p>

                  <p>Tintin was one of my favourites when I was a kid, and I was delighted to find several volumes of Tim und Struppi, the German translation, in this shop. My German isn't particularly good and I thought that buying one or two albums would be a great way to improve my language skills: there isn't all that much to read in the books, the art helps with understanding the story, and I vaguely remember how they go anyway because of many afternoons in my childhood reading the English translations of Tintin.</p>

                  <p>It was fun to read and it helped me get in touch with my inner child. The other book I bought, Im Reiche des Schwarzen Goldes, remains on my bookshelf as of August 2017. It's going on my to-read list soon.</p>

                  <p>Tsar is probably the best of Ted Bell's novels. It's not <i>too</i> unbelievable and I feel something of a connection with the magical descriptions of Russian palaces in the winter. When I went to Saint Petersburg many years ago it was in November so I did not get the proper Russian winter experience, but I can easily imagine the Hermitage twinkling under a fresh snowfall.</p>

                  <p>2012 was a year of milestones for my family: my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, my mother's 50<sup>th</sup>, her father's 80<sup>th</sup> and his mother's 100<sup>th</sup>, and at the beginning of July that year I went over to England on my own and stayed with my dad's parents in Cumbria for a little while. Come Nana's centenary, however, I needed to be in Harrogate, so I went on the train on a route first to Manchester and then onward via Leeds (or was it York?).</p>

                  <p>The train across the Pennines was patently uncomfortable and my back ached miserably by the time I got to my destination. I needed a nap, so I went to bed in my mum's parents' guest room at five or six in the afternoon and slept until one or so the following day. My lengthy sleep gave my granny something of a fright.</p>

                  <p>It was in this context that I read The Riddle of the Sands: about half of it on the way to Yorkshire and the other half on the rather more direct train over the dales and to Cumbria via Carnforth. There is something special about WWI-era spy thrillers; they're a window into the history of both politics and writing. I can't describe why, but Childers's tale of a spy sailing boat prowling the Frisian Islands is much more engaging than it sounds at face value.</p>

                  <p>My dad's parents got me into David Baldacci's books, and they got into his work (particularly the Camel Club series) because they enjoyed reading stories set in places they know, having visited us outside Washington DC numerous times since we moved here in 2001.</p>

                  <p>One day, while I was on holiday after the end of high school, we went on a day trip to Liverpool to see the International Slavery Museum and the Turner Monet Twombly exhibition at the Tate. My granddad had a couple of ratty paperbacks on hand he thought I might enjoy reading, and this was one of them. I tore through it on the car journey: I got halfway through on the drive to Liverpool, and I finished it on the way back.</p>

                  <p>It's hardly highbrow, but reading these books is something I share with my grandparents and that is special to me.</p>
